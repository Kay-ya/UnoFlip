## Gameplay features:

Player Interaction: Players actively participate in the game by choosing cards to play, making colour selections for Wild cards, and making strategic decisions.

Turn-Based Play: The game operates on a turn-based system, allowing each player to take their actions in sequence.

Special Action Cards: Action cards introduce unique effects, such as drawing cards, skipping turns, or altering the direction of play.

Dynamic Color Selection: Players can dynamically choose the colour they want to match when playing Wild cards, adding a strategic element to the game.


## How to play:
This game can be run in the Game.java file in our repository

The game will prompt you to enter the names of players.

Each player will be dealt 7 cards to start the game.

Players take turns playing cards that match the top card's number or colour on the discard pile.

Special action cards (e.g., Draw Two, Skip, Reverse, Wild) have unique effects and can change the course of the game.

The game continues until one player successfully clears their hand of cards.

The winner is declared, and the game ends.
